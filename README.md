# The skeleton and practice version of the website for our system before we officially created a new one.
## The final finished product has 4 core features. NFC, Blockchain, Digital Signatures, and AI Contract Analysis.

I made this by myself to understand Nuxt Vue, AdonisJS and Typescript. Practicing here significantly improved my understanding for our actual system.

The main and final code for the system can be seen here <a href = "https://github.com/DAPPropTech"> DAPProptech </a>, but it is currently private and closed.

This is no longer being updated and will only serve as a reminder of my initial learnings of Typescript and its frameworks.
